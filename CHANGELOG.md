## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-05

Initial release accompanying the manuscript *"Unsupervised mineral phase
mapping from SEM-EDS element maps: a density-based clustering pipeline with
multi-resolution refinement"* (submitted to Computers & Geosciences, 2026).

### Added

- Five-stage checkpointed pipeline (`load -> mask -> denoise -> normalize ->
  cluster`) driven by the `karak` CLI with Rich TUI, HDF5 checkpoints, and
  `--from-stage` resume support.
- Colormap inversion of false-color SEM-EDS element maps (jet or any
  matplotlib colormap, or custom `.npy` LUT) to scalar [0, 1] intensities
  via a cached 256^3 RGB-to-scalar lookup table.
- Background/epoxy masking from a napari valid-region polygon CSV combined
  with all-channel-zero detection.
- Edge-aware denoising (bilateral filter or anisotropic diffusion) on raw
  intensities, followed by per-channel z-score normalization over mineral
  pixels.
- PCA dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN density-based phase discovery
  with two strategies: `global` (with optional subsample +
  `approximate_predict`) and `tiled` (per-tile HDBSCAN with cosine-similarity
  phase-registry merging).
- Optional two-pass rare-phase reclustering and post-clustering refinement
  (threshold-based olivine extraction, GMM sub-phase splitting).
- kNN distance-weighted reassignment of HDBSCAN noise pixels.
- Per-cluster chemical fingerprinting with cosine-similarity flagging of
  potentially over-split clusters, plus human-in-the-loop mineral naming.
- QC figure generation at every stage (mask overlays, denoise comparisons,
  scree plots, phase maps, fingerprint charts).
- Full provenance: pipeline config YAML, library versions, platform info,
  and per-stage timestamps embedded in every HDF5 output.
- Pydantic-validated YAML configuration covering every pipeline parameter,
  with seeded randomness (`random_state`) for reproducible runs.
- Fast pytest suite (config round-trip, colormap inversion, mask utilities,
  synthetic end-to-end smoke test) and GitHub Actions CI.
